      A Bactopia Tool which uses a variety of assembly tools to create an assembly of
      Illumina and Oxford Nanopore reads.
  introduction: |
      The `assembler` module uses a variety of assembly tools to create an assembly of
      Illumina and Oxford Nanopore reads. The tools used are:

      | Tool | Description |
      |------|-------------|
      | [Dragonflye](https://github.com/rpetit3/dragonflye) | Assembly of Oxford Nanopore reads, as well as hybrid assembly with short-read polishing |
      | [Shovill](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) | Assembly of Illumina paired-end reads |
      | [Shovill-SE](https://github.com/rpetit/shovill) | Assembly of Illumina single-end reads |
      | [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) | Hybrid assembly, using short-reads first then long-reads |

      Summary statistics for each assembly are generated using [assembly-scan](https://github.com/rpetit3/assembly-scan).
  output:
    tree: Tree in main
    add_note: false

          Below is a description of the _per-sample_ results for a hybrid assembly using
          [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler). When using Unicycler, the
          short-reads are assembled first, then the long-reads are used to polish the
          assembly.
