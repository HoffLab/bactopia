In order for a tool to be added to [Bactopia Tools](https://bactopia.github.io//bactopia-tools/#available-bactopia-tools), 
it must be available on  [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules). 
__But!!__ Don't let that stop you from suggesting a tool! Time permitting and depending on the feasibility I can help you
get a tool on Bioconda and/or nf-core/modules. _So! Suggest away!_
